# Deglacial-Neutralized-Carbon-14C
This repository contains the plotting code and the simulation results for the four experimental runs used in our "Deglacial Pulse of Neutralized Carbon from the Pacific Seafloor: Constraints from the Radiocarbon Budget" manuscript, submitted to GRL.

There are two folders, "data" and "code". The "data" folder contains observational data (in the subfolder "observations") needed for Figures 1 and 3 and model data (in the subfolder "model") need for Figure 1, 2, and 3. The model data comes as a .txt file with XY columns and XY rows. The columns are:

 Within the "code" folder, there are the three Python scripts for each figure. 
 This code should be ran from the root of the directory by typying "python code/Figure1.py" for example.
